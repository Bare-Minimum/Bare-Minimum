# Bare-Minimum   Travel with Friends

> Travel App was created with the intention of support you and your friends to organize and share details of your next trip, the app allows you to plan and store all the details related:
 - where you are going.
 - for how long.
 - details of lodging.
Once the basic details of the trip are created you can invite your friends to join. At that point everyone will have access to the trip dashboard that has all the relevant information and a map of the location where you are going. 
In addition to that everyone can add landmarks that they are interested in visiting and the trip members can vote, creating an interactive way to select what to do during the trip. Also the possibility of sharing the expenses of the trip so everyone can keep track of budget.
